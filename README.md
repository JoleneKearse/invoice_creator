Final project in Scrimba's [Learn JavaScript for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/module-3-final-solo-project-invoice-creator-cVbPpRhD) course.

The object was to make an Invoice Creator, which could dynamically add a company's services with JavaScript. Then customers can click which services to bill their customers for. An itemized service and price list is generated.

Special notes can be added and the total amount due would be automatically updated.

The extra feature is a remove button to take the item and price off the itemized invoice, and, of course, deduct that amount from the total.
